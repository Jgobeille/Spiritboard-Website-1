Now there's a temporary solution.\nI stand by my racial slur. Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing.\n\nLisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.
